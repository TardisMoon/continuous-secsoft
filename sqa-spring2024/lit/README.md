# Literature Review of Publications 

## Objective 

As part of this assignment you are expected to read and summarize recent publications related to serverless computing. 

## Target Audience 

Students enrolled in COMP 6710 and COMP 6710-D 

## Tasks 

- Read all 11 papers in the `lit/papers` directory
- Create a report with the following contents:
  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `HPC Domain`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `HPC Domain` report the context of where serverless computing is used. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `HPC Domain` is `resource allocation`. 
  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `Technique Name`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `Technique Name` report the name of the proposed technique/framework/algorithm in the paper. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `Technique Name` is `LIBRA`.   
  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `Metrics Used`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `Metrics Used` report the metrics that are used for evaluation. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `Metrics Used` are `latency` and `resource utilization`.
  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `Evaluation Plan`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `Evaluation Plan` report the experimental setup used in the paper. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `Evaluation Plan` are `single node cluster`, `multi node cluster` and `Jetstream cluster`.
  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `Challenges`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `Challenges` report the challenges used in the paper. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `Challenges` are:
    - How to estimate the resource demands and execution time of invocations with varying input data transparently?
    - How to harvest idle resources safely at a fine granularity? 
    - How to maximize cluster-wide invocation acceleration and idle resource utilization?
  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `Applications`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `Applications` report the applications used to evaluate the proposed technique in the paper. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `Applications` are:
    - Uploader
    - Thumbnailer 
    - Compression 
    - DNA Visualization 
    - Dynamic HTML 
    - Video Processing 
    - Image Recognition 
    - Graph Pagerank 
    - Graph Minimum-spanning-tree 
    - Graph Breadth-first-search

  - A table with three columns: `PaperID`, `Title`, `Research Gap`. Here, `PaperID` and `Title` are respectively, paper IDs and paper titles. For `Research Gap` report the research gaps reported in the paper. For example, for paper `1`, the `Title` is `Libra: Harvesting Idle Resources Safely and Timely in Serverless Clusters`, and the `Research Gap` is:
    - ignorance of timelinessâ€”harvested resources' availability may expire 
    - no support to varying input sizes 
    - lack of timely release of harvested resources.
